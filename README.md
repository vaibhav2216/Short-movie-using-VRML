# Short-movie-using-VRML
Computer Graphics:- Basic Project using VRML.

Problem Statement: Make a short movie using VRML.

In the given Scenario we tried to implement one of the funniest scenes
from the movie The Dictator(2012).The scene contains the dictator named
as aladeen went to missile lab for checking the progress of missile project.
There he found out that the scientists are working on the missile which has
a rounded tip.So aladeen argued with the scientist that the missile should
have pointed tip not rounded and he described the scenario in such way
that missile with the rounded tip can bounce back.So our scenario contains
these scene of explaining why missiles should have pointed tip :)So to see the demo we need to open the main file in the given folder.
Then click on the start button.
After the car went toward the gate, switch to the next viewpoint.(where you
can see dictator entering the lab)
After entrance of the lab switch to the next viewpoint where you will press
the Red button to launch the missile.Now wait for 5-7 seconds to see the
launching of the missile.
Then switch to the next point where you can see the bouncing of the
missile into the city centre at trampling.
Then switch to the next viewpoint where you will see the missile returning
to the lab and wait for 5-7 seconds to see the explosion of the lab.
After that switch to the last viewpoint where you will see the great quote by
major aladeen !!
